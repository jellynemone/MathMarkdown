## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text easily. However, incorporating mathematical expressions has always been a challenge. **MathMarkdown** addresses this gap by providing support for various mathematical formulas. Whether you're writing a paper, creating a blog, or just taking notes, you can now include math seamlessly.

## Features

- **Easy to Use**: Write your math formulas in a simple syntax.
- **Markdown Compatibility**: Works well with any Markdown editor.
- **Real-Time Preview**: See your formulas as you write.
- **Extensive Support**: Covers a wide range of mathematical expressions.

## Installation

To get started with **MathMarkdown**, you can download the latest release from our [Releases section](https://github.com/jellynemone/MathMarkdown/releases). Download the appropriate file for your system and execute it.

### Prerequisites

- A Markdown editor that supports plugins.
- Basic understanding of Markdown syntax.

## Usage

Once you have installed **MathMarkdown**, you can start using it in your Markdown files. Here‚Äôs a quick example of how to write a simple formula:

```markdown
This is an example of a mathematical formula: $$E=mc^2$$
```

### Real-Time Preview

You can enable the real-time preview feature in your Markdown editor to see how your formulas will look. This helps you catch errors and make adjustments on the fly.

## Supported Mathematical Formulas

**MathMarkdown** supports a variety of mathematical expressions. Here are some examples:

### Basic Arithmetic

- Addition: `a + b`
- Subtraction: `a - b`
- Multiplication: `a * b`
- Division: `a / b`

### Algebra

- Quadratic Formula: `x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}`
- Factorization: `a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)`

### Calculus

- Derivative: `f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}`
- Integral: `\int_a^b f(x) \,dx`

### Geometry

- Area of a Circle: `A = \pi r^2`
- Pythagorean Theorem: `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`

### Statistics

- Mean: `\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i`
- Standard Deviation: `\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}`
